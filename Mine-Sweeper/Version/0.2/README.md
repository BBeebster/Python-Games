This is the second version of the game.
I took a break from the project but came back and fixed issues with the old game in about an hour of work.
Now when you click a square initially it generates the mines after to guarentee you will have a fair start.
I also got rid of the layered frame and destroying frame process, instead just updating the one layer of frames as needed.
